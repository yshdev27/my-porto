## üîß Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get this project running locally on your machine.

### **Step 1: Get Your Spotify Credentials**

1.  Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in.
2.  Click **"Create app"** and give it a name and description.
3.  Once created, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4.  Click **"Edit Settings"** and add the following **Redirect URI**:
    * `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/spotify/callback`

### **Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables**

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  In the root of the project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
3.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env.local` and fill in your Spotify **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

    ```env
    # .env.local

    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=Your_Client_ID_Goes_Here
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=Your_Client_Secret_Goes_Here
    SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN= # We will get this in the next step
    ```

### **Step 3: Get Your Personal Refresh Token**

This is a one-time setup to allow the server to access your data permanently.

1.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  In your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/spotify/login`.
4.  Log in to your Spotify account and grant permission.
5.  You will be redirected to a page displaying your **Refresh Token**. Copy this long string.
6.  Paste the token into your `.env.local` file for the `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` variable.
7.  **Restart your server** (`Ctrl + C` and `npm run dev`) for the new variable to take effect.

### **Step 4: Run the Project**

You're all set! Your local development server is running, and the Spotify component on your homepage should now be displaying your data.
